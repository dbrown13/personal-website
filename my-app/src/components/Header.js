                As a former biology and biomedical sciences student, I bring a unique variation of analyzation, intuition, and investigation skills to my work as a software engineer. With a strong background in the biomedical sciences and a deep understanding of the human body and its behavior, I am able to approach problem-solving from multiple angles and create user-friendly solutions. I have gained skills in solving and analyzing a problem without seeing it in its physical form, granting me skills that are helpful in the debugging aspect of the tech world. Whether I am developing new applications or enhancing applications that already exist, I am driven by a passion for creating functional and appealing applications. I am excited to bring my diverse skill set and fresh perspective to any team, and I am always on the search for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a front-end or full-stack developer.
